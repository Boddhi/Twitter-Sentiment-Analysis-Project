The prepackaged population is trained to distinguish between positive and negative input. However, the framework can be adapted for any 
binary (true/false) string-based queries, e.g. Spam detection.

Features:
The Wilson Score is used to calculate the given success of a word.
Principles of genetic programming are applied to determine which word-value associations yields the most successful interpretations of input.
Sarcasm detection is a notable weakness.

Training Instructions:
The program can be trained from within the GUI (at the "Train" page). However, if larger quantities of data are desired to be inputted, training by file is also possible.
Simply create an "Update.txt" file of the following format and save it in the same folder as the program file.

Sample Update.txt - integer n, followed by n positive lines, then integer m, followed by m negative lines

Notes:
* With great power comes great responsibility: if you want accurate output, give accurate training input.
* The Twitter API limits the amount of queries that can be made per minute by a program. If the analysis will not change from neutral, just wait a minute or two.
